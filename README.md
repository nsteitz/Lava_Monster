# Monsters

- A summary of your program, including a list of concepts used 
This program is intended to be a playable game in which you have to choose which route to take and then depending on the
route you will face different challenges/obstacles. More specifically, you will be facing the monsters that were created and each monster has their own
challenge. If you succeed in beating the monster's challenges you win the game and are then able to bring milk back to your family from the store.
If you do not succeed, you will meet your demise and lose the game. This program uses inheritance class relationship and file input. The monsters that were created
for this project, Lava Monster and Woods Monster, are abstract classes that have other classes that extend them. For example, crack monster "is a" lava monster
and cemetery monster "is a" woods monster. There is also file input in both woods monster and lava monster. Both of them use files
to read in data to use for the challenges that the user will face. All of this code was also written if C++.

Starter Code and credit
For this project our professor Lisa Dion at the University of Vermont provided all the files in the water, sky, and darknesss folder with TODO's that we also completed. My team mate Nathaniel Borrok-Hoffman also created the woods monster file and I created the lava monser ones.
