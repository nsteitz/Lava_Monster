- A summary of your program, including a list of Module 2 concepts used
This program is intended to be a playable game in which you have to choose which route to take and then depending on the
route you will face different challenges/obstacles. More specifically, you will be facing the monsters that were created and each monster has their own
challenge. If you succeed in beating the monster's challenges you win the game and are then able to bring milk back to your family from the store.
If you do not succeed, you will meet your demise and lose the game. This program uses inheritance class relationship and file input. The monsters that were created
for this project, Lava Monster and Woods Monster, are abstract classes that have other classes that extend them. For example, crack monster "is a" lava monster
and cemetery monster "is a" woods monster. There is also file input in both woods monster and lava monster. Both of them use files
to read in data to use for the challenges that the user will face.

- Any known bugs at time of submission
One bug is that when displaying the Harry Potter quotes, the quotes may be repeated. So, you may get prompted the same quote multiple times in one game.

- Future work (how you could expand the program with more time)
In future work, when given more time this program should be tested like we had to do for the monster's guided project.
It could also be expanded upon in a way that would allow for component class relationships.

- Citations for any code not written by you or the instructor
- The grade you think you have earned, based on the grading rubric
- Based on the grading rubric I believe that we have earned 80 points. This is because 
we have fulfilled the requirements and put in a lot of work, except for testing the program. 
We have designed the classes robustly, used inheritance relationship, file input, input validation,
have descriptive comments, a video, and have a long lifespan and many commits for the project.
